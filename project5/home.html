    <h1>About Us</h1>

        <h2>1940s</h2>
        <p>Born and raised on a dairy farm, my family spent our days milking and caring for the cows. Our parents always prioritized the importance of high-quality milk that my siblings cherished each day. Our favorite treat involving milk being our homemade ice cream of course! As teenagers we started experimenting with the flavors, and despite trying other brands, nothing beat the richness of our milk. Friends and neighbors started encouraging us to take our treats to the streets and start selling.</p>

        <p>After talking as a family, we could not resist the urge to dive into this idea so we started planning and saving money. We knew we had the quality, but to expand our menu we needed fellow farms to supply fruit. And Berry Sweet Creamery was born! And ever since we have delivered handcrafted ice cream made with love and care to our community. Spreading our childhood joy, from our family to yours.</p>

        <p>I met Henry at Berry Sweet eight years ago when we were still in high school. We started dating and the ice cream there was so delicious that we kept coming back. Now we are celebrating our honeymoon and have Berry Sweet to thank!</p>
